## What is sexual harassment at workplace?

Sexual harassment at the workplace is any unwelcome sexually defined behaviour which has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with the individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, abusive or offensive working environment.

## What kinds of behavior cause sexual harassment?

1. **Verbal Harassment**:  
   - Making inappropriate sexual remarks, jokes, or innuendos.  
   - Requesting sexual favors.  

2. **Non-Verbal Actions**:  
   - Staring, leering, or making suggestive facial expressions or gestures.
   - Sending unwanted or inappropriate sexual messages, emails, or texts.  

3. **Physical Misconduct**:  
   - Engaging in unwelcome physical contact, such as touching, hugging, or kissing.  
   - Blocking someone's movement or invading their personal space inappropriately. 

4. **Quid Pro Quo Harassment**:  
   - Exerting pressure for sexual favors in return for professional advantages, like promotions or job security.  

5. **Creating a Hostile Work Environment**:  
   - Repeated inappropriate behavior that makes the workplace uncomfortable or degrading.  

## Scenarios and Possible Reactions

1. **Artistic Freedom**
   - **Scenario**: Someone might justify inappropriate comments, gestures, or sharing explicit content (such as art, photos, or jokes) by labeling it as "artistic expression" or "freedom of speech."  
   - **Reaction**: Calmly but assertively remind them that professional and respectful conduct is expected in the workplace. If the behavior persists or causes discomfort, I will report it.

2. **Equal Appreciation**
   - **Scenario**: Compliments or attention are directed unequally, crossing professional boundaries (e.g., showing undue favoritism toward one individual).  
   - **Reaction**: Establish clear boundaries. If the behavior makes me uncomfortable or becomes excessive, document the incidents and report them to HR or a manager.

3. **Everyone Loves a Compliment**
   - **Scenario**: Persistent personal compliments, especially those with suggestive or inappropriate undertones, may cause discomfort.  
   - **Reaction**: Politely communicate that the compliments are unwelcome. If the behavior continues, escalate the matter to HR.

4. **Odd Man Out**
   - **Scenario**: An individual feels excluded or targeted in the workplace due to their gender, creating a hostile environment.  
   - **Reaction**: Address the exclusion by raising the issue with colleagues or supervisors. Document any incidents of hostility and report them if necessary.

5. **Testing the Waters**
   - **Scenario**: Subtle or boundary-testing behaviors, such as suggestive jokes or inappropriate comments, are used to gauge response.  
   - **Reaction**: Address such behavior immediately by stating that it is unprofessional. If it persists, escalate the issue to HR.

6. **The Contract**
   - **Scenario**: Demands, either explicit or implied, for sexual favors in exchange for career advancement or job security.  
   - **Reaction**: Refuse to comply, document the incident in detail, and report it immediately to HR or legal authorities.

7. **The Joke’s on You**
   - **Scenario**: Sexual or offensive jokes are made at the workplace, creating an uncomfortable atmosphere.  
   - **Reaction**: Inform the person that such jokes are inappropriate and unwelcome. If the issue persists, involve HR.

8. **The Legend**
   - **Scenario**: Gossip or rumors of a sexual nature are spread about someone, potentially harming their reputation.  
   - **Reaction**: Gather evidence and report the issue to HR, requesting immediate action to stop the rumors.

9. **Twisted Words**
   - **Scenario**: My words or actions are intentionally misrepresented or twisted into something inappropriate.  
   - **Reaction**: Clarify my intent directly with the person involved. If the behavior is malicious, document the incident and report it to HR.

10. **You Gotta Keep Trying**
    - **Scenario**: Unwanted advances or attention persist despite clear refusals or a lack of interest.  
    - **Reaction**: Firmly refuse and report the behavior to HR or a supervisor if it continues.



## What would I do in case I  face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behavior?

1. **Confront the Behavior**:  
   - Address the individual politely but firmly, making it clear that their behavior is unacceptable.  
   - Set boundaries to communicate your discomfort effectively.  

2. **Record the Incident**:  
   - Keep a detailed record of what happened, including dates, times, locations, and any witnesses.  
   - Preserve evidence such as texts, emails, or other communications related to the incident.  

3. **Report the Incident**:  
   - Use my organization's reporting channels, such as HR, a manager, or a designated complaints committee.  
   - If internal channels fail, will consider escalating the matter to external authorities.  

4. **Support Victims**:  
   - If I witness harassment, stand by the victim and encourage them to report the behavior.  
   - I will offer to act as a witness or provide support during the reporting process.  

5. **Seek Advice and Guidance**:  
   - Approach workplace counselors or legal advisors for assistance in understanding my rights and next steps.  
   - Attend workplace awareness sessions or training programs to equip myself with knowledge on handling harassment.  

6. **Consider Legal Action if Needed**:  
   - If internal remedies are insufficient, take formal action by filing a complaint under workplace harassment laws.  



## How to behave appropriately?

1. **Respect Boundaries**: Always maintain professional distance and avoid physical contact without consent.
2. **Mind Language**: Avoid making inappropriate or suggestive comments or jokes.
3. **Respect Personal Space**: Be mindful of others' comfort zones and personal space.
4. **Be Aware of Non-Verbal Cues**: Pay attention to body language to gauge comfort levels.
