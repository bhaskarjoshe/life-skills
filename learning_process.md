# Learning Process

*"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."* - Albert Einstein

## Question 1 - What is the Feynman Technique? 
The Feynman Technique is a deep learning process that explains concepts in simple terms and refining understanding through iteration.


The Feynman Technique typically involves four key steps:
- **Choose a Topic**: I start by selecting a topic I want to understand better.
- **Explain it Simply**: I explain the topic in the simplest terms possible as if teaching it to a child.
- **Find Weak Spots**: While explaining, I notice the areas where I struggle or my explanation is unclear.
- **Refine and Simplify**: I research, clarify my understanding, and make my explanation even simpler.

## Question 2 - In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
The Pomodoro Technique is a simple way to manage time while studying or working. Here’s how it works:

1. **Set a Timer for 25 Minutes**: Focus on the task, like studying or working on a project, for 25 minutes without distractions.
2. **Take a 5-Minute Break**: Once the timer goes off, take a short 5-minute break to relax and recharge.
3. **Repeat**: Do this three more times—25 minutes of focused work followed by 5-minute breaks.
4. **Longer Break**: After four 25-minute sessions (about 2 hours), take a longer break, like 15-30 minutes.

**Example**:
When studying for a test:

- Set the timer for 25 minutes and study a chapter.
- After 25 minutes, take a 5-minute break—stretch, get a drink, or walk around.
- Repeat this cycle for the next 2 hours, and after that, take a 15-30 minute longer break to rest before continuing.

This method helps maintain focus, avoid distractions, and keep energy levels up throughout study sessions.

## Question 3 - What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

1. **Active Mode**: This is when the brain is fully engaged, focusing on a specific task or problem with high attention to detail.

    -  **Example**: While writing an essay, active thinking involves focusing on organizing ideas, structuring sentences, and choosing the right words to express thoughts clearly.

2. **Diffused Mode**: This is when the brain is in a relaxed, open state, allowing ideas to flow without intense focus, often leading to creative solutions.

    -   **Example:** After spending time writing the essay, taking a break and letting the mind wander might lead to a fresh way of introducing the essay or unexpectedly refining the argument.
    
The scenario of writing an essay demonstrates how both modes complement each other -<br> Active Mode helps with focused work, while Diffused Mode encourages creative breakthroughs after a period of rest.

## Question 4 - According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.

1. Deconstruct the skill
2. Learn enough to self-correct
3. Remove practice barriers
4. Practice at least 20 hours

## Question 5 - What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?
1. **Apply the Feynman Technique**:  
    - Simplify complex concepts by explaining them in straightforward language.  
    - Identify areas where understanding is weak and focus on clarifying them.

2. **Use the Pomodoro Technique**:  
    - Break learning into 25-minute intervals with short 5-minute breaks in between.  
    - After completing four intervals, take a longer break to recharge.

3. **Follow Steps for Approaching a New Topic**:  
    - Begin by mastering the basic concepts and dividing the topic into smaller sections.  
    - Review the material regularly and reflect on the key points to strengthen understanding.
