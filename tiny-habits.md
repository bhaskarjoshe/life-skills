# Tiny Habits

## Question 1 - What was the most interesting story or idea for you in this video?

**Anchor Technique** - This tiny habits strategy emphasizes creating new habits by anchoring them to existing routines.

"After I [current habit], I will [new habit]"

## Question 2 - How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A, and P.

**B = MAP** is a model by BJ Fogg for forming new habits:

- **M (Motivation)**: The desire or drive to perform the behavior. Higher motivation increases the chance of making the habit.
- **A (Ability)**: The ease of performing the behavior. Making the habit simple and small increases the likelihood of success.
- **P (Prompt)**: A reminder or trigger that cues the behavior. A well-timed prompt ensures the habit happens.

Optimizing these three elements makes new habits easier to form and more likely to stick.

### Question 3 - Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?

1. **Positive Reinforcement**: Celebrating strengthens neural pathways, making the habit more likely to be repeated.
2. **Emotional Connection**: Creates a positive association with the habit, increasing enjoyment and motivation.
3. **Consistency**: Reinforces the habit through regular celebration, building momentum.
4. **Motivation**: Celebration boosts motivation to continue performing the habit.
5. **Habit Formation**: Celebrating solidifies the behavior, making it more ingrained and automatic over time.

### Question 4 - What was the most interesting story or idea for you in this video?

### 1. Failure Prevention Strategy

- **Purpose**: Minimizes setbacks that could derail progress.
- **Approach**:
  - Identify potential obstacles and plan ahead to avoid them.
  - Build systems that reduce reliance on willpower, such as preparing environments that support the habit.
  - Focus on consistency over perfection. Missing one day is acceptable, but avoid missing two consecutive days to prevent a downward spiral.
- **Example**: Preparing meals in advance to prevent unhealthy eating.

### 2. Seinfeld Strategy

- **Purpose**: Builds consistency through a visual streak-tracking method.
- **Origin**: Named after comedian Jerry Seinfeld, who used a calendar to track daily writing habits. The goal is to "not break the chain" of consecutive days of action.
- **Approach**:
  - Mark every day the habit is completed on a calendar or habit tracker.
  - Celebrate small wins daily to reinforce the behavior.
  - Focus on maintaining the streak rather than perfect outcomes.
- **Examples**: Record a streak for completing a daily walk, even if just for 5 minutes.

## Question 5: What is the book's perspective on Identity?

The book emphasizes that habits should be rooted in identity for lasting change.

- Focus on who to become rather than what to achieve.
- Example: Thinking of being a "healthy person" naturally encourages habits like eating nutritious food or exercising consistently.

## Question 6: Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do.

Making a habit easier involves reducing effort and increasing convenience:

- **Reduce friction:** Remove obstacles that make starting the habit harder.
- **Prepare ahead:** Set up tools or resources beforehand, like laying out workout clothes the night before.
- **Start small:** Apply the "two-minute rule" to make the habit effortless to begin.
- Example: Keeping a water bottle on the desk encourages drinking water regularly.

## Question 7: Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do.

Making a habit harder involves adding obstacles or reducing accessibility:

- **Increase friction:** Introduce steps that make the habit less convenient.
- **Remove cues:** Eliminate triggers from the environment that prompt the habit.
- **Use commitment devices:** Set up barriers or consequences to prevent the habit.
- Example: Removing junk food from the house discourages unhealthy snacking.

## Question 8: Pick one habit that you would like to do more of.

**Reading more books**

Steps to improve the habit:

- **Make the cue obvious:** Keep books within sight, such as on a coffee table or nightstand.
- **Make it more attractive:** Choose books on topics of personal interest or set a reading challenge.
- **Make it easy:** Start with short books or read a few pages each day.
- **Make the response satisfying:** Track reading progress and reward finishing a chapter or book.

## Question 9: Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of.

**Procrastinating on important tasks**

Steps to reduce the habit:

- **Make the cue invisible:** Remove distractions like turning off notifications or clearing the workspace.
- **Make it unattractive:** Write down the negative consequences of delaying tasks to create urgency.
- **Make it hard:** Set specific times to work on tasks and use tools like website blockers to stay focused.
- **Make the response unsatisfying:** Reflect on the wasted time or create accountability by sharing progress with someone.
