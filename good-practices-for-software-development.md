# Good Practices for Software Development

## Question 1 - Which point(s) were new to you?

1. Writing down all questions in a single message to avoid bombarding teammates with multiple messages.
2. Joining meetings 5â€“10 minutes early to build rapport with team members.
3. Keeping the video on during meetings to enhance communication and rapport.
4. Using tools like Loom, GitHub Gists, and sandbox environments (e.g., CodePen, CodeSandbox) for effective problem explanation.
5. Blocking social media sites/apps during work hours to maintain focus.
6. Managing food intake and exercising to maintain energy levels for better productivity.

## Question 2 - Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

**Area to Improve:**  
Communicating effectively when stuck on a problem and improving attention management during work.

**Ideas to Make Progress:**

1. **For Communication:**

   - Learn to structure questions better by clearly explaining the problem and attempted solutions.
   - Practice using tools like Loom, GitHub Gists, or sandbox environments to make it easier for others to understand the problem.
   - Observe how issues are reported in open-source projects to improve clarity and precision.

2. **For Attention Management:**
   - Use tools like Freedom or TimeLimit to block distracting websites during work hours.
   - Enable only work-related notifications and silence others.
   - Establish a daily routine with fixed time slots for focused work, meals, and exercise.
   - Explore and implement techniques from "Deep Work" to enhance concentration.
